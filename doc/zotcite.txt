==============================================================================
1. Overview                                                 *zotcite_overview*


Zotcite is a Vim plugin that provides integration with Zotero. Please, see a
description of its features, including screenshots at:

    https://github.com/jalvesaq/zotcite


==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                       *zotcite_usage*

Zotcite can extract and insert into the markdown document (1) annotations that
you have made using Zotero's built-in PDF viewer, (2) notes that you have
attached to a Zotero entry, and (3) annotations inserted in a PDF by an
external PDF viewer.

To extract annotations made with Zotero's built-in PDF viewer, use the Vim
command `:Zannotations key` where `key` is a word with one or more letters of
authors' names or from a reference title. If the PDF has page labels, Zotero
will register them as the page numbers; otherwise, Zotero will consider the
first page of the PDF as page 1 which in most cases will be wrong. You can fix
this by passing an integer number as a second argument to `:Zannotations`. For
example, if page 1 of a book is page 11 of its PDF, you will get the correct
page numbers if you do:
>vim
 :Zannotations key -10
<
By default, the colon separating the year from the page is replaced by ", p.
". If you want to use the colon or any other string as the separator, set the
value of `year_page_sep` in your `config`. Example:
>lua
 year_page_sep = ':'
<
To extract annotations made with Zotero's built-in PDF viewer but would prefer
to make a selection of the annotations that you would like to import then use
the vim command `:Zselectannotations key` where `key` is a word with one or
more letters of authors' names or from a reference title. In the use case, a
second dialogue will appear in which the annotations and accompanying notes to
those annotations will appear (if you have made notes). You can scroll through
the annotation list and press `enter` on the annotations you'd wish to import.
Once finished making the selection then you need to press `Esc` to escape the
annotation selection dialogue.
>vim
  :Zselectannotations key
<
To extract notes from Zotero, use the Vim command `:Znote key`

Similarly, to extract annotations (notes and highlighted texts) that were
inserted into a PDF document by an external PDF viewer, use the Vim command
`:Zpdfnote`. The page numbers of the annotations might be wrong, so always
check them after the extraction. You have also to manually add italics and
other rich text formatting and put back hyphens incorrectly removed from the
end of the PDF lines.

To insert citation keys, install `cmp-zotcite`:

   https://github.com/jalvesaq/cmp-zotcite

Then, in Insert mode, type the `@` letter and one or more letters of either
the last name of the first author or the reference title. The matching of
citation keys is case-insensitive.

You can also use Telescope to insert a citation key by pressing <C-X><C-B> in
Insert mode. The sequence of ASCII letters (letter of the English alphabet)
before the cursor will be used to filter the results (see `:Zseek` below).

To convert a Markdown document with pandoc, use the `zotref.py` filter that comes
with Zotcite. The Zotcite plugin adds the directory where `zotref.py` is to the
system `$PATH`. So, from within Neovim, do:
>vim
 :!pandoc file_name.md -s -o file_name.html -F zotref.py --citeproc
<
Replace `file_name` with the actual name of the markdown document being
edited, and `html` with the appropriate file extension.

To compile an RMarkdown document with the Nvim-R plugin
(https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R), add the following lines to the YAML
header of the document (replace `pdf_document` with the desired output):
>yaml
 output:
   pdf_document:
     pandoc_args: ['-F', 'zotref.py', '--citeproc']
<
Note: On Windows, you might have to replace `zotref.py` with its full path.
Example:
>yaml
 output:
   pdf_document:
     pandoc_args: ['-F', '/Path/to/zotcite/python3/zotref.py', '--citeproc']
<
Note: Old versions of `pandoc` require `-F pandoc-citeproc` instead of
`--citeproc`.

Note: On Windows, `zotref.py` will convert the bib file from "latin1" to
"utf-8". If "latin1" is not the Zotero encoding in your region, set
`zotero_encoding` with the correct value in your `config`. Example:
>lua
 zotero_encoding = 'latin2'
<
In Vim's Normal mode, put the cursor over a citation key and press:

  - <Leader>zo to open the reference's attachment as registered in Zotero's
    database.

  - <Leader>zi to see in the status bar the last name of all authors, the
    year, and the title of the reference.

  - <Leader>za to see all fields of a reference as stored by Zotcite.

  - <leader>zb to extract the abstract into the currently open buffer if its
    available.

  - <Leader>zy to see how the reference will be converted into YAML.

  - <Leader>zv to view the (pdf or html) document generated from the current
    (Markdown, Rmd, or Quarto) document.

You can also use the command `:Zseek` to see what references have either a
last author's name or title matching the pattern that you are seeking for. The
references displayed in a Telescope picker widget will be the same that would
be in an omni completion menu. Example:
>vim
 :Zseek marx
<
Only the first word is used as the search pattern. Thus, the following command
would give the same result as the above one:
>vim
 :Zseek marx anything
<
The Telescope picker is filled with references that include the searched
pattern as a substring in the author's names or the work's title, but
Telescope allows you to further fuzzy filter the results. If you want the
Telescope picker filled with Zotero's entire database, run `:Zeek` without
arguments.

The goal of Zotcite is to avoid the need for exporting bib files from Zotero.
The `zotref.py` filter receives the Markdown document from its standard input,
extracts all citation keys from the document, gets all corresponding
references from the Zotero database, inserts all references in the YAML header
of the document, and, finally, returns the enhanced document to `pandoc`. If
there is a "bibliography" field in the YAML header, it will be used. If one of
the bib files listed in the "bibliography" field has a name ending with the
"zotcite.bib" string it will be overwritten. If there is a "bibliography"
field in the YAML header, but none of the bib files listed ends in
"zotcite.bib", a temporary one will be created.

It is possible --- but not recommended --- to mix bib files that are generated
and overwritten by zotcite with other ones because the final document may
include duplicated references. Anyway, if you have an old bib file and want to
complement it with Zotero references, you can put in your YAML header:
>yaml
 bibliography:
   - old.bib
   - new-zotcite.bib
<
or, simply:
>yaml
 bibliography: old.bib
<
If you have an OpenDocument Text with citations inserted by the Zotero
extension and want to convert it to Markdown, you can use the `odt2md.py`
application from the `python3` directory to help you convert the document.
Example:
>sh
 /path/to/zotcite/python3/odt2md.py Document.odt
<
Within Neovim, you can run the command `:Zodt2md` to convert the ODT document
and see the resulting Markdown document in a new tab:
>vim
 :Zodt2md Document.odt
<
Note that the conversion is not perfect because the visible text from the
citation fields is not deleted. You have to delete them manually, keeping what
is needed, such as the page numbers that you have added manually. It is not
possible to automate this step because LibreOffice allows the manual edition
of the citation fields.


==============================================================================
3. Suggested workflow                                       *zotcite_workflow*

  1. Use Zotero's browser connector to download papers in PDF format.

  2. Read the papers, highlighting important passages, and making annotations.

  3. Run the command `:Zpdfnote` to extract your notes from the PDF document and
     insert them into the markdown document.

  5. Finish editing your markdown document.


==============================================================================
4. Customization

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Change default maps                                     *zotcite_mappings*

To change the shortcut to open reference attachment, set the value of
<Plug>ZOpenAttachment in your |init.lua| as below:
>lua
 vim.keymap.set("n", "<c-]>", "<Plug>ZOpenAttachment")
<
To change the shortcut to see basic information on the reference of a citation
key, follow the example:
>lua
 vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader>I", "<Plug>ZCitationInfo")
<
To change the shortcut to see how the reference of a citation key is stored by
Zotcite, follow the example:
>lua
 vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader>A", "<Plug>ZCitationCompleteInfo")
<
To change the shortcut to see how the reference is converted into YAML, follow
the example:
>lua
 vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader>Y", "<Plug>ZCitationYamlRef")
<
To change the shortcut to extract the abstract into the current buffer from the
abstract field in complete info:
>lua
 vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader>Y", "<Plug>ZExtractAbstract")
<
To change the shortcut to view the (pdf or html) document generated from the
current (Markdown, Rmd, or Quarto) document, follow the example:
>lua
 vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader>V", "<Plug>ZViewDocument")
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Zotcite engine                                            *zotcite_engine*

							   *citation_template*
The citation keys inserted by Zotcite have the format `@ZoteroKey#Author_Year`
where `ZoteroKey` is the key attributed by Zotero to the references stored in
its database, `Author` is the last name of the first author, and `Year` is the
full year (four digits). The `@ZoteroKey#` part of the citation key is
mandatory because `zotref.py` uses it to add the bibliographic data that is
parsed by `citeproc`, but it will be concealed by Vim. The remainder of
the key is customizable. You can define whether it will include or not the
first author's last name (in either lower case `{author}` or title case
`{Author}`), the last name of the first three authors (either `{authors}` or
`{Authors}`), the first word of the title (`{title}` or `{Title}`) and the
year (with either four digits `{Year}` or only two `{year}`). Examples:
>lua
 citation_template = '{author}{year}'
 citation_template = '{Authors}_{Year}_{Title}'
<
								*banned_words*
The following words are deleted from the title before its first word is
selected: a, an, the, some, from, on, in, to, of, do, and with. If you want to
ban a different set of words, define `banned_words` in your `config` as in the
examples:
>lua
 -- Spanish
 banned_words = 'el la las lo los uno una unos unas al de en no con para'
 -- French
 banned_words = 'la les l un une quelques à un de avec pour'
 -- Portuguese
 banned_words = 'o um uma uns umas à ao de da dos em na no com para'
 -- Italian
 banned_words = 'la le l gli un una alcuni alcune all alla da dei nell con per'
 -- German
 banned_words = 'der die das ein eine einer eines einem einen einige im zu mit für von'
<
								    *SQL_path*
If Zotcite cannot find the path to Zotero's database (`zotero.sqlite`), put
the correct path in your `config`:
>lua
 SQL_path = '/path/to/zotero.sqlite'
<
								      *tmpdir*
If Zotcite is trying to use a non-writable directory as its temporary and
cache directory, or if for any reason you want to change this directory,
follow the examples:
>lua
 tmpdir = '/path/to/temporary_and_cache_directory'
 tmpdir = '/dev/shm/zotcite-user_name'
<
When Zotero's SQLite3 database is updated, zotcite copies it to its temporary
directory. While copying, the slowest operation is writing the copy of the
file to disk. If you have enough RAM, you may want to set `tmpdir` as a
directory in a file system mounted in virtual memory, as in the second example
above.
							      *exclude_fields*
If you want to exclude some of Zotero's fields from the YAML references
generated by Zotcite, set the value of `exclude_fields` to a white-separated
list of fields to be excluded. For example, if you want to exclude the fields
"Extra" (which appears as `note` in the YAML references) and "attachment", put
this in your `config`:
>lua
 exclude_fields = "note attachment"
<
							   *Zotero_collection*
If you want to restrict the search for references to specific collections
while completing citation keys, set the value `collection` in the YAML header
of the Markdown document, as in the examples:
>
 ---
 collection: ['New Paper']
 ---

 ---
 collection: ['PhD Thesis', 'New Paper']
 ---
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 Syntax Highlighting                                 *zotcite_highlighting*

Syntax highlighting customization is done with Vim variables.

								  *hl_cite_key*
If you want to disable Zotcite's syntax highlighting of citation keys, put in
your `config`:
>lua
 hl_cite_key = false
<
							*zotcite_conceallevel*
Zotcite sets the 'conceallevel' of the Markdown document to 2. If you want a
different value, follow the example:
>lua
 conceallevel = false
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4 File types                                             *zotcite_filetypes*

Zotcite is enabled only if the file type is `markdown`, `pandoc`, `rmd`,
`quarto` or `vimwiki`. If you want it enabled for other file types, you should
set the value of `filetypes` in your `config`. Example:
>lua
 filetypes = { 'markdown', 'pandoc', 'rmd', 'vimwiki' }
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5 Open attachment

Zotcite calls `vim.ui.open()` to open attachments. But you can change the
command in your config:
>lua
 open_cmd = "my_open_script"
<
If you want <Plug>ZOpenAttachment to open PDF attachments in Zotero (as
opposed to your system's default PDF viewer), put the following in your
`config`:
>lua
 open_in_zotero = true
<
Note that you'll need to have Zotero configured as the default app for
opening `zotero://` links. On Linux, assuming your Zotero installation
included a `zotero.desktop` file, you can do the following:
>sh
 xdg-mime default zotero.desktop x-scheme-handler/zotero
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.6 Show errors of command to open attachment        *zotcite_wait_attachment*

While opening an attachment, zotcite cannot catch errors because it doesn't
wait for the application to finish. If zotcite fails to open a PDF attachment,
you may want to temporarily set `wait_attachment` as `true` in your `config`:
>lua
 wait_attachment = true
<
Then, Neovim should freeze until the attachment is closed, and, if the PDF
viewer finishes with non-zero status, anything output to the `stderr` will be
displayed as a warning message.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.7 Quarto render filters                              *zotcite_quarto_render*

If you add the `filters` field to the YAML header of a Quarto document, the
filters will be run after the `citeproc` filter. However, the `zotref.py`
filter must be run before `citeproc`. The best solution for this problem might
be to create a file named `citeproc.lua` with the following contents and save
it somewhere:
>lua
 function Pandoc (doc)
   return pandoc.utils.citeproc(doc)
 end
<
Then, do not use either the `bibliography` field or the `citeproc` field (if
you use one of them, `citeproc` will run before `zotref.py`) and put in the
header of your Quarto document:
>yaml
 filters:
     - /full/path/to/zotcite/python3/zotref.py
     - /full/path/to/your/citeproc.lua
     - /full/path/to/zotcite/python3/apafix.py
<
Of course, the last filter should be added only if using the APA citation style.
It will replace "&" with "and" in in-text citations. If using the Brazilian
citation style, you could try the `abntfix.py` filter to fix in-text citations.

For a Lua filter to fix the APA citation style, see:

  https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/issues/3748


==============================================================================
5. Troubleshooting                                   *zotcite_troubleshooting*

								      *:Zinfo*
If either the plugin does not work or you want easy access to the values of
some internal variables, do the following command:
>vim
 :Zinfo
<
Note that, unless you are editing Quarto documents, Zotcite will not enable
omni completion if any of the buffer's lines matches the regular pattern
`^bibliography:.*\.bib` when the markdown file is read.
								      *:Zrefs*
You can check the YAML references generated by Zotcite with the command
`:Zrefs` which will insert in the document the list of references. This is
useful if `citeproc` fails to parse the references.

If you cannot make the `zotref.py` script work you have to manually add the
references to the YAML header of your document with the command `:Zrefs` and
delete and add the references again each time that you either cite or remove
the citation to a reference. Then, if there are only ASCII characters in the
references you will have a chance of successfully compiling the document.
