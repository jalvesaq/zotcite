Typical shapes of persistent slip markings are extrusions accompanied by parallel intrusions. In some cases only extrusions were developed and intrusions were produced later in fatigue life. In polycrystalline copper extrusions and intrusions appear on the surface of the grain where persistent slip band characterized by ladder-like dislocation structure egress on the surface. Similar features were observed in fatigued austenitic 316L and Sanicro 25 steels but the extrusion and intrusion shapes were more complicated. Crack-like intrusion shapes produce high stress and strain concentration and primary stage I crack starts to grow from the tip of intrusions. The experimental observations were compared with the predictions of the existing crack initiation models.'),\n",

The dislocation structure of the persistent slip bands and the evolution of the surface relief resulting in the formation of persistent slip markings during cyclic loading are documented. The dislocation mechanisms leading to production of point defects in cyclic loading are described and point defect production and annihilation rates are derived. The kinetics of point defect migration is characterized. The physically based models of the surface relief formation describing the formation of extrusions and intrusions are presented.

       "  'The fatigue life of a component can be expressed as the sum of two segments of life: (a) the number of loading cycles required to initiate a crack and (b) the number of cycles it takes that crack to propagate to failure. In this review, the primary emphasis is relating the fatigue crack initiation to the microstructure of the material. Many studies have focused on this phenomenon over the years and the goal of this paper is to put this work in perspective and encourage future work of fatigue in polycrystals based on the material’s microstructure. In order to address fatigue, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that facilitate crack initiation. Slip irreversibilities exist in a material and accumulate during fatigue loading. At the defect level, irreversibilities are a result of dislocations: annihilating, cross-slipping, penetrating precipitates, transmitting through grain boundaries, and piling-up. These slip irreversibilities are the early signs of damage during cyclic loading. The dislocations subsequently form low-energy, stable structures as a means to accommodate the irreversible slip processes and increasing dislocation density during cyclic forward and reverse loading. The result is strain localizing in a small region within the materials, i.e. persistent slip bands and dislocation cells/bundles. Strain localization is a precursor to crack initiation. This review paper will focus on experimental observations of strain localization and the theory and numerical analysis of both slip irreversibilities and low energy configuration defect structures. This fundamental understanding is necessary to study persistent slip bands in FCC metals and alloys including the appropriate characterization, theory, and modeling. From this fundamental knowledge both micromechanical and crystal plasticity models can be used to predict crack initiation, which are also reviewed. Finally, this review ends with a discussion of the future of fatigue modeling and experiments.'),\n",

       "  'Analysis of inhomogeneous cyclic straining, observation of surface relief at emerging persistent slip bands (PSBs) and data on point defect generation and migration in fatigued metal single cyrstals and polycrystals are the origin of a new model for fatigue crack initiation in PSBs. Because of the high plastic strain amplitude, non-equilibrium point defects are generated in PSBs. They are distributed inhomogeneously according to the inhomogeneous sink distribution. Point defect migration over short distances causes mass transport and results in the formation of extrusions and intrusions on the metal surface. The distribution of extrusions and intrusions is related to the dislocation substructure of the PSB. Cyclic straining under stress together with the strain concentration at sharp intrusions result in environment-assisted formation of new surfaces and therefore in crack initiation.'),\n",

       "  'The role of point defects in the formation of surface relief and in the initiation of a fatigue crack in crystalline materials is analyzed. The dislocation interactions in the bands of intensive cyclic slip (persistent slip bands - PSBs) are specified and relations describing the formation and annihilation of interstitial and vacancy type defects in the channels of the ladder-like PSB are derived. The continuous formation, annihilation and primarily the migration of point defects are proposed to be responsible for the mass redistribution within PSB and between PSB and the PSB/matrix boundary. The redistribution of the matter results in local tensile and compressive stresses that are the sources of the principal irreversibility of slip within PSB. Local tensile and compressive stresses are relaxed by dislocation movement within PSB in the direction of the active Burgers vector and lead to the formation of characteristic surface relief in the form of extrusions and intrusions. The intrusions represent crack-like defects and fatigue cracks initiate in the tip of intrusions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'),\n",

       "  \"This paper reviews the problems and successes of computing turbulent flow. Most of the flow phenomena that are important to modern technology involve turbulence. The review is concerned with methods for turbulent flow computer predictions and their applications, and describes several of them. These computational methods are aimed at simulating either as much detail of the turbulent motion as possible by current computer power or, more commonly, its overall effect on the mean-flow behaviour. The methods are still being developed and some of the most recent concepts involved are discussed. Some success has been achieved with two-equation models for relatively simple hydrodynamic phenomena; indeed, routine design work has been undertaken during the last three decades in several applications of engineering practise, for which extensive studies have optimised these models. Failures are still common for many applications particularly those that involve strong curvature, intermittency, strong buoyancy influences, low-Reynolds-number effects, rapid compression or expansion, strong swirl, and kinetically-influenced chemical reaction. New conceptual developments are needed in these areas, probably along the lines of actually calculating the principal manifestation of turbulence, e.g. intermittency. A start has been made in this direction in the form of 'multi-fluid' models, and full simulations. The turbulence modelling approaches presented here are, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), two-fluid models, Very Large Eddy Simulation (VLES), Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and some interesting, relatively recent, hybrid LES/RANS techniques. A large number of relatively recent studies are considered, together with reference to the numerical experiments existing on the subject. The authors hope that they provide the interested reader with most of the appropriate sources of turbulence modelling, exhibiting either as much detail as it is possible, by means of bibliography, or illustrating some of the most recent developments on the numerical modelling of turbulent flows. Thus, the potential user has the appropriate information, for him to select the suitable turbulence model for his own case of interest.\"),\n",

The expressions are self-consistent in that the driving force defined as the negative derivative of the total energy with respect to the dislocation position, is equal to the force produced by stress, through the Peach-Koehler formula. The singularity intrinsic to the classical continuum theory is removed here by spreading the Burgers vector isotropically about every point on the dislocation line using a spreading function characterized by a single parameter a, the spreading radius. A particular form of the spreading function chosen here leads to simple analytic formulations for stress produced by straight dislocation segments, segment self and interaction energies, and forces on the segments. For any value a>0, the total energy and the stress remain finite everywhere, including on the dislocation lines themselves. Furthermore, the well-known singular expressions are recovered for a=0. The value of the spreading radius a can be selected for numerical convenience, to reduce the stiffness of the dislocation equations of motion. Alternatively, a can be chosen to match the atomistic and continuum energies of dislocation configurations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'),\n",

       "  'In this paper we establish a mathematical framework for a range of inverse problems for functions, given a finite set of noisy observations. The problems are hence underdetermined and are often ill-posed. We study these problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian statistics, with the resulting posterior probability measure being defined on a space of functions. We develop an abstract framework for such problems which facilitates application of an infinite-dimensional version of Bayes theorem, leads to a well-posedness result for the posterior measure (continuity in a suitable probability metric with respect to changes in data), and also leads to a theory for the existence of maximizing the posterior probability (MAP) estimators for such Bayesian inverse problems on function space. A central idea underlying these results is that continuity properties and bounds on the forward model guide the choice of the prior measure for the inverse problem, leading to the desired results on well-posedness and MAP estimators; the PDE analysis and probability theory required are thus clearly dileneated, allowing a straightforward derivation of results. We show that the abstract theory applies to some concrete applications of interest by studying problems arising from data assimilation in fluid mechanics. The objective is to make inference about the underlying velocity field, on the basis of either Eulerian or Lagrangian observations. We study problems without model error, in which case the inference is on the initial condition, and problems with model error in which case the inference is on the initial condition and on the driving noise process or, equivalently, on the entire time-dependent velocity field. In order to undertake a relatively uncluttered mathematical analysis we consider the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation on a torus. The case of Eulerian observations - direct observations of the velocity field itself - is then a model for weather forecasting. The case of Lagrangian observations - observations of passive tracers advected by the flow - is then a model for data arising in oceanography. The methodology which we describe herein may be applied to many other inverse problems in which it is of interest to find, given observations, an infinite-dimensional object, such as the initial condition for a PDE. A similar approach might be adopted, for example, to determine an appropriate mathematical setting for the inverse problem of determining an unknown tensor arising in a constitutive law for a PDE, given observations of the solution. The paper is structured so that the abstract theory can be read independently of the particular problems in fluid mechanics which are subsequently studied by application of the theory. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.'),\n",

       "  'The local size of computational grids used in partial differential equation (PDE)-based probabilistic inverse problems can have a tremendous impact on the numerical results. As a consequence, numerical model identification procedures used in structural or material engineering may yield erroneous, mesh-dependent result. In this work, we attempt to connect the field of adaptive methods for deterministic and forward probabilistic finite-element (FE) simulations and the field of FE-based Bayesian inference. In particular, our target setting is that of exact inference, whereby complex posterior distributions are to be sampled using advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Our proposal is for the mesh refinement to be performed in a goal-oriented manner. We assume that we are interested in a finite subset of quantities of interest (QoI) such as a combination of latent uncertain parameters and/or quantities to be drawn from the posterior predictive distribution. Next, we evaluate the quality of an approximate inversion with respect to these quantities. This is done by running two chains in parallel: (i) the approximate chain and (ii) an enhanced chain whereby the approximate likelihood function is corrected using an efficient deterministic error estimate of the error introduced by the spatial discretisation of the PDE of interest. One particularly interesting feature of the proposed approach is that no user-defined tolerance is required for the quality of the QoIs, as opposed to the deterministic error estimation setting. This is because our trust in the model, and therefore a good measure for our requirement in terms of accuracy, is fully encoded in the prior. We merely need to ensure that the finite element approximation does not impact the posterior distributions of QoIs by a prohibitively large amount. We will also propose a technique to control the error introduced by the MCMC sampler, and demonstrate the validity of the combined mesh and algorithmic quality control strategy.'),\n",

       "  'Inverse problems are often ill posed, with solutions that depend sensitively on data.n any numerical approach to the solution of such problems, regularization of some form is needed to counteract the resulting instability. This paper is based on an approach to regularization, employing a Bayesian formulation of the problem, which leads to a notion of well posedness for inverse problems, at the level of probability measures. The stability which results from this well posedness may be used as the basis for quantifying the approximation, in finite dimensional spaces, of inverse problems for functions. This paper contains a theory which utilizes this stability property to estimate the distance between the true and approximate posterior distributions, in the Hellinger metric, in terms of error estimates for approximation of the underlying forward problem. This is potentially useful as it allows for the transfer of estimates from the numerical analysis of forward problems into estimates for the solution of the related inverse problem. It is noteworthy that, when the prior is a Gaussian random field model, controlling differences in the Hellinger metric leads to control on the differences between expected values of polynomially bounded functions and operators, including the mean and covariance operator. The ideas are applied to some non-Gaussian inverse problems where the goal is determination of the initial condition for the Stokes or Navier-Stokes equation from Lagrangian and Eulerian observations, respectively. © 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.'),\n",

The stability of the stationary solution is determined by the direct method of Liapounov, supplemented with results for the linearized method. The stability criterion is firmly based on the form of the boundary condition linked to the rock destruction process. This rock/bit interaction function can be deduced using studies on rock mechanics, based on yield design formalism. Assuming a quasi-static axial evolution, numerical simulations illustrate the instability of the stationary solution: the bit motion can converge on a limit cycle, often called stick-slip. The beam therefore evolves as a complex cone-shaped limit surface. A simple two-degrees-of-freedom system is now considered in both axial and torsional directions, to quantify the quasi-static axial assumption. The instability of the stationary solution is confirmed by the linearized method for the undamped system with the postulated boundary conditions. Even for small damping values the same result is achieved. Even though a limit cycle appears in the axial plane (small amplitude), stick-slip can be described adequately by considering a quasi-static axial evolution.'),\n",

A little more than fifty years of studying problems of this kind have shown that a great number of problems from various branches of classical mathematics (computational algebra, differential and integral equations, partial differential equations, functional analysis) can be classified as inverse or ill-posed, and they are among the most complicated ones (since they are unstable and usually nonlinear). At the same time, inverse and ill-posed problems began to be studied and applied systematically in physics, geophysics, medicine, astronomy, and all other areas of knowledge where mathematical methods are used. The reason is that solutions to inverse problems describe important properties of media under study, such as density and velocity of wave propagation, elasticity parameters, conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and properties and location of inhomogeneities in inaccessible areas, etc. In this paper we consider definitions and classification of inverse and ill-posed problems and describe some approaches which have been proposed by outstanding Russian mathematicians A.

       "  'In this paper we study the mixing times of a Wright-Fisher model for an asexual population. Typically, such models consist of a population of several genotypes where each genotype reproduces at a different rate, genotypes can mutate to each other, and the population is subject to the evolutionary pressure of selection. While such models have been used extensively to study different types of populations, recently, such stochastic finite population models have been used to model viral populations with the goal of understanding the effect of mutagenic drugs. Here, the time it takes for the population to reach a steady state is important both for carrying out simulations and to determine treatment strength and duration. Despite their importance, and having been widely studied, there has been a lack of such bounds for many relevant ranges of model parameters even for the case of two genotypes (single locus); primarily due to their difficulty, see [Ethll]. The main result of this paper is an analytical bound on the mixing time of a Wright-Fisher model for two genotypes when there is no restriction on the mutation rate or the fitness. Our bound explains (in this setting) the observed phenomena that the mixing time is fast (logarithmic in the state space) for any fitness parameter when the mutation rate is high enough. Theoretically, we overcome the difficulty in proving mixing time bounds by showing that different forces are responsible for the rapid mixing depending on how close it is to its steady state. If the chain is sufficiently close to its stationary distribution, an intricate coupling argument establishes rapid mixing. To show that the chain reaches this state quickly, we connect it to the convergence time of a deterministic model for evolution proposed by Eigen. We are hopeful that our insights and techniques will be helpful in establishing rigorous bounds for more general versions of this model.'),\n",

       "  'This article is concerned with the evolution of haploid organisms that reproduce asexually. In a seminal piece of work, Eigen and coauthors proposed the quasispecies model in an attempt to understand such an evolutionary process. Their work has impacted antiviral treatment and vaccine design strategies. Yet, predictions of the quasispecies model are at best viewed as a guideline, primarily because it assumes an infinite population size, whereas realistic population sizes can be quite small. In this paper we consider a population genetics-based model aimed at understanding the evolution of such organisms with finite population sizes and present a rigorous study of the convergence and computational issues that arise therein. Our first result is structural and shows that, at any time during the evolution, as the population size tends to infinity, the distribution of genomes predicted by our model converges to that predicted by the quasispecies model. This justifies the continued use of the quasispecies model to derive guidelines for intervention. While the stationary state in the quasispecies model is readily obtained, due to the explosion of the state space in our model, exact computations are prohibitive. Our second set of results are computational in nature and address this issue. We derive conditions on the parameters of evolution under which our stochastic model mixes rapidly. Further, for a class of widely used fitness landscapes we give a fast deterministic algorithm which computes the stationary distribution of our model. These computational tools are expected to serve as a framework for the modeling of strategies for the deployment of mutagenic drugs. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.'),\n",

Bids cannot be retracted, as is frequently the case in auctions. Our main methodological contribution is that we construct a mapping from this general stochastic process into a distribution of values that is independent of the type of auction considered. The equilibria of a static auction with this distribution of values is used to characterize the equilibria of the dynamic auction, making this general class very tractable. As a result of the option of future rebidding, early bids are shaded and under mild conditions increase toward the end of the auction. Our results are consistent with repeated bidding and skewness of the time distribution of winning bids, two puzzling observations in dynamic auctions. As an application, we estimate the model by matching moments from eBay auctions.'),\n",

       "  'In this paper we study the mixing time of evolutionary Markov chains over populations of a fixed size (N) in which each individual can be one of m types. These Markov chains have the property that they are guided by a dynamical system from the m-dimensional probability simplex to itself. Roughly, given the current state of the Markov chain, which can be viewed as a probability distribution over the m types, the next state is generated by applying this dynamical system to this distribution, and then sampling from it N times. Many processes in nature, from biology to sociology, are evolutionary and such chains can be used to model them. In this study, the mixing time is of particular interest as it determines the speed of evolution and whether the statistics of the steady state can be efficiently computed. In a recent result [Panageas, Srivastava, Vishnoi, Soda, 2016], it was suggested that the mixing time of such Markov chains is connected to the geometry of this guiding dynamical system. In particular, when the dynamical system has a fixed point which is a global attractor, then the mixing is fast. The limit sets of dynamical systems, however, can exhibit more complex behavior: they could have multiple fixed points that are not necessarily stable, periodic orbits, or even chaos. Such behavior arises in important evolutionary settings such as the dynamics of sexual evolution and that of grammar acquisition. In this paper we prove that the geometry of the dynamical system can also give tight mixing time bounds when the dynamical system has multiple fixed points and periodic orbits. We show that the mixing time continues to remain small in the presence of several unstable fixed points and is exponential in N when there are two or more stable fixed points. As a consequence of our results, we obtain a phase transition result for the mixing time of the sexual/grammar model mentioned above. We arrive at the conclusion that in the interesting parameter regime for these models, i.e., when there are multiple stable fixed points, the mixing is slow. Our techniques strengthen the connections between Markov chains and dynamical systems and we expect that the tools developed in this paper should have a wider applicability.'),\n",

Results from an experimental sale of real goods, testing revenue equivalence of the open and sealed- bid second-price auction do not conform to theoretical predictions: the open auction leading to significantly lower prices than the sealed-bid auction. It turns out that the open auction format allows bidders to satisfy a tendency to “stick together” with their valuations. The empirical results motivate a dynamic bidding model of interdependent valuations, bidders being uncertain about their valuations and learning from the exit-prices of their rivals. Furthermore, bidding behaviour on the Internet is investigated in the hard close and the automatically extended auction. Late bidding is shown to be a rational strategy in the hard close auction, but not in the automatically extended auction. Theoretical results show that the expected final price and seller revenue is lower in the hard close auction than in the automatically extended auction, where prestige-concerns can lead to an explosive final price. Moreover, Yahoo auction data confirms the strong presence of late bidding in the hard-close auction and the seller’s preference for the automatically extended auction.'),\n",

       "  \"The molecular quasi-species model describes the physicochemical organization of monomers into an ensemble of heteropolymers with combinatorial complexity by ongoing template polymerization. Polynucleotides belong to the simplest class of such molecules. The quasi-species itself represents the stationary distribution of macromolecular sequences maintained by chemical reactions effecting error-prone replication and by transport processes. It is obtained deterministically, by mass-action kinetics, as the dominant eigenvalue of a value matrix, W, which is derived directly from chemical rate coefficients, but it also exhibits stochastic features, being composed to a significant fraction of unique individual macromolecular sequences. The quasi-species model demonstrates how macromolecular information originates through specific nonequilibrium autocatalytic reactions and thus forms a bridge between reaction kinetics and molecular evolution. Selection and evolutionary optimization appear as new features in physical chemistry. Concentration bias in the production of mutants is a new concept in population genetics, relevant to frequently mutating populations, which is shown to greatly enhance the optimization properties. The present theory relates to asexually replicating ensembles, but this restriction is not essential. A sharp transition is exhibited between a drifting population of essentially random macromolecular sequences and a localized population of close relatives. This transition at a threshold error rate was found to depend on sequence lengths, distributions of selective values, and population sizes. It has been determined generically for complex landscapes and for special cases, and, it was shown to persist genetically in the presence of nearly neutral mutants. Replication dynamics has much in common with the equilibrium statistics of complex spin systems: the error threshold is equivalent to a magnetic order-disorder transition. A rational function of the replication accuracy plays the role of temperature. Experimental data obtained from test-tube evolution of polynucleotides and from studies of natural virus populations support the quasi-species model. The error threshold seems to set a limit to the genome lengths of several classes of RNA viruses. In addition, the results are relevant even in eucaryotes where they contribute to the exon-intron debate. 1. Molecular Selection Our knowledge of physical and chemical systems is, in a final analysis, based on models derived from repeatable experiments. While none of the classic and rather besieged list of properties rounded up to support the intuition of a distinction between the living and nonliving-metabolism, self-reproduction, irritability, and adaptability, for example-intrinsically limit the application of the scientific method, a determining role by unique or individual entities comes into conflict with the requirement of repeatability. Combinatorial variety, such as that in heteropolymers based on even very small numbers of different bases, even just two, readily provides numbers of different entities so enormous that neither consecutive nor parallel physical realization is possible. The physical chemistry of finite systems of such macromolecules must deal with both known regularities and the advent of unique co-polymeric sequences. Normally this would present no difficulty in a statistical mechanical analysis of typical behavior, where rare events play no significant role, but with autocatalytic polymeri-zation processes even unique single molecules may be amplified to determine the fate of the entire system. Potentially creative, self-organizing around unique events, the dynamics of this simplest living chemical system is invested with regularities that both allow and limit efficient adaptation. The quasi-species model is a study of these regularities. The fundamental regularity in living organisms that has invited explanation is adaptation. Why are organisms so well fitted to their environments? At a more chemical level, why are enzymes fThis is an abridged account of the quasi-species theory that has been submitted in comprehensive form to Advances in Chemical Physics.' 0022-3654/88/2092-6881 $01.50/0 optimal catalysts? Darwin's theory of natural selection has provided biologists with a framework for the answer to this question. The present model is constructed along Darwinian lines but in terms of specific macromolecules, chemical reactions, and physical processes that make the notion of survival of the fittest precise. Not only does the model give an understanding of the physical limitations of adaptation, but also it provides new insight into the role of chance in the process. For an understanding of the structure of this minimal chemical model it is first necessary to recall the conceptual basis of Darwin's theory. Darwin recognized that new inheritable adaptive properties were not induced by the environment but arose independently in the production of offspring. Lasting adaptive changes in a population could only come about by natural selection of the heritable traits or genotype based on the full characteristics or phenotype relevant for producing offspring. A process of chance, i.e., uncorrelated with the developed phenotype, controls changes in the genotype from one generation to the next and generates the diversity necessary for selection. Three factors have probably prevented chemists from gaining a clear insight into these phenomena in the past, despite the discovery of the polymeric nature of the genotype (DNA): the complexity of a minimum replication phenotype, the problem of dealing with a huge number of variants, and the nonequilibrium nature of these ongoing processes.\"),\n",

An important special case of such a stochastic process is the Wright-Fisher model from evolutionary biology (with selection and mutation) on a population of size N over m genotypes. Our main result implies that the mixing time of this process is O(log N) for all mutation rates and fitness landscapes, and solves the main open problem from [4].In particular, it significantly extends the main result in [18] who proved this for m = 2. Biologically, such models have been used to study the evolution of viral populations with applications to drug design strategies countering them. Here the time it takes for the population to reach a steady state is important both for the estimation of the steady-state structure of the population as well in the modeling of the treatment strength and duration. Our result, that such populations exhibit rapid mixing, makes both of these approaches sound. Technically, we make a novel connection between Markov chains arising in evolutionary dynamics and dynamical systems on the probability simplex. This allows us to use the local and global stability properties of the fixed points of such dynamical systems to construct a contractive coupling in a fairly general setting. We expect that our mixing time result would be useful beyond the evolutionary biology setting, and the techniques used here would find applications in bounding the mixing times of Markov chains which have a natural underlying dynamical system.'),\n",

This paper highlights the beautiful mathematical framework, coupled with practical algorithms, which results from thinking probabilistically about inverse problems arising in partial differential equations. Many inverse problems in the physical sciences require the determination of an un-known field from a finite set of indirect measurements. Examples include oceanography, oil recovery, water resource management and weather forecasting. In the Bayesian ap-proach to these problems, the unknown and the data are modelled as a jointly varying random variable, typically linked through solution of a partial differential equation, and the solution of the inverse problem is the distribution of the unknown given the data. This approach provides a natural way to provide estimates of the unknown field, to-gether with a quantification of the uncertainty associated with the estimate. It is hence a useful practical modelling tool. However it also provides a very elegant mathematical framework for inverse problems: whilst the classical approach to inverse problems leads to ill-posedness, the Bayesian approach leads to a natural well-posedness and stability theory. Furthermore this framework provides a way of deriving and developing algo-rithms which are well-suited to the formidable computational challenges which arise from the conjunction of approximations arising from the numerical analysis of partial differen-tial equations, together with approximations of central limit theorem type arising from sampling of measures.'),\n",

This inherent drawback of the hard thresholding renders the traditional thresholding algorithms unstable and thus generally inefficient for solving practical sparse optimization problems. How to overcome this weakness and develop a truly efficient thresholding method is a fundamental question in this field. The aim of this paper is to address this question by proposing a new thresholding technique based on the notion of optimal k-thresholding. The central idea for this new development is to connect the k-thresholding directly to the residual reduction during the course of algorithms. This leads to a natural design principle for the efficient thresholding methods. Under the restricted isometry property, we prove that the optimal thresholding based algorithms are globally convergent to the solution of sparse optimization problems. The numerical experiments demonstrate that when solving sparse optimization problems, the traditional hard thresholding methods have been significantly transcended by the proposed algorithms which can even outperform the classic `1-minimization method in many situations.'),\n",

Our reformulation has several equivalent interpretations, allowing for researchers from various communities to leverage their domain specific insights. In particular, our reformulation can be equivalently seen as a stochastic optimization problem, stochastic linear system, stochastic fixed point problem and a probabilistic intersection problem. We prove sufficient, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the reformulation to be exact. Further, we propose and analyze three stochastic algorithms for solving the reformulated problem—basic, parallel and accelerated methods—with global linear convergence rates. The rates can be interpreted as condition numbers of a matrix which depends on the system matrix and on the reformulation parameters. This gives rise to a new phenomenon which we call stochastic preconditioning, and which refers to the problem of finding parameters (matrix and distribution) leading to a sufficiently small condition number. Our basic method can be equivalently interpreted as stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Newton method, stochastic proximal point method, stochastic fixed point method, and stochastic projection method, with fixed stepsize (relaxation parameter), applied to the reformulations.'),\n",

Interest in these methods was recently revitalized by a proof of Strohmer and Vershynin showing linear convergence in expectation for a \\\\textit{randomized} Kaczmarz method variant (RK), and a similar result for the randomized Gauss-Seidel algorithm (RGS) was later proved by Lewis and Leventhal. Recent work unified the analysis of these algorithms for the overcomplete and undercomplete systems, showing convergence to the ordinary least squares (OLS) solution and the minimum Euclidean norm solution respectively. This paper considers the natural follow-up to the OLS problem, ridge regression, which solves $(\\\\boldsymbol{X}^* \\\\boldsymbol{X} + \\\\lambda \\\\boldsymbol{I}) \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} = \\\\boldsymbol{X}^* \\\\boldsymbol{y}$. We present particular variants of RK and RGS for solving this system and derive their convergence rates.

Instead, we claim that one should always use RGS (columns) when $m > n$ and RK (rows) when $m < n$. This difference in behavior is simply related to the minimum eigenvalue of two related positive semidefinite matrices, $\\\\boldsymbol{X}^* \\\\boldsymbol{X} + \\\\lambda \\\\boldsymbol{I}_n$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{X} \\\\boldsymbol{X}^* + \\\\lambda \\\\boldsymbol{I}_m$ when $m > n$ or $m < n$.'),\n",

Furthermore, this is the first solver whose rate does not depend on the number of equations in the system. The solver does not even need to know the whole system but only a small random part of it. It thus outperforms all previously known methods on general extremely overdetermined systems. Even for moderately overdetermined systems, numerical simulations as well as theoretical analysis reveal that our algorithm can converge faster than the celebrated conjugate gradient algorithm.

At each step, the method projects the current iterate onto the solution space of a single constraint. Hence, it requires very low cost per iteration and storage, and it has a linear rate of convergence. Distributed implementations of Kaczmarz have become, in recent years, the de facto architectural choice for large-scale linear systems. Therefore, in this paper we develop a family of randomized block Kaczmarz algorithms that uses at each step a subset of the constraints and extrapolated stepsizes, and can be deployed on distributed computing units. Our approach is based on several new ideas and tools, including stochastic selection rule for the blocks of rows, stochastic conditioning of the linear system, and novel strategies for designing extrapolated stepsizes. We prove that randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm converges linearly in expectation, with a rate depending on the geometric properties of the matrix and its submatrices and on the size of the blocks. Our convergence analysis reveals that the algorithm is most effective when it is given a good sampling of the rows into well-conditioned blocks. Besides providing a general framework for the design and analysis of randomized block Kaczmarz methods, our results resolve an open problem in the literature related to the theoretical understanding of observed practical efficiency of extrapolated block Kaczmarz methods.'),\n",

Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), matching pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB). Basis pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an \"optimal\" superposition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, abstract harmonic analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising. BP in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear and quadratic programming by interior-point methods.

In this work, we consider separable inverse problems, where the data are modeled as a linear combination of functions that depend nonlinearly on certain parameters of interest. These parameters may represent neuronal activity in a human brain, frequencies of electromagnetic waves, fluorescent probes in a cell, or magnetic relaxation times of biological tissues. Separable nonlinear inverse problems can be reformulated as underdetermined sparse-recovery problems, and solved using convex programming. This approach has had empirical success in a variety of domains, from geophysics to medical imaging, but lacks a theoretical justification. In particular, compressed-sensing theory does not apply, because the measurement operators are deterministic and violate incoherence conditions such as the restricted-isometry property. Our main contribution is a theory for sparse recovery adapted to deterministic settings. We show that convex programming succeeds in recovering the parameters of interest, as long as their values are sufficiently distinct with respect to the correlation structure of the measurement operator. The theoretical results are illustrated through numerical experiments for two applications: heat-source localization and estimation of brain activity from electroencephalography data.'),\n",

The maximum hands-off control is the minimum support (or sparsest) per unit time among all controls that achieve control objectives. For finite horizon continuous-time control, we show the equivalence between the maximum hands-off control and L1-optimal control under a uniqueness assumption called normality. This result rationalizes the use of L1 optimality in computing a maximum hands-off control. The same result is obtained for discrete-time hands-off control. We also propose an L1/L2-optimal control to obtain a smooth hands-off control.

This hinders the applicability of the previously published Kaczmarz algorithm with projection adjustment (KAPA) to large-scale problems. An enhancement EKAPA of KAPA that uses projection adjustment only for a small subset of the equations is proposed for significantly reducing the time and storage requirements. An analysis of the behavior of EKAPA is provided. An illustration is given to show that EKAPA using a small subset of the equations for projection adjustment can achieve a speed-up over KA similar to that of KAPA in terms of the number of iterations, but requires much less computer time and storage; hence, it is more suitable for large-scale problems.'),\n",

       "  'Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used dimensionality reduction tools in scientific data analysis. The PCA direction, given by the leading eigenvector of a covariance matrix, is a linear combination of all features with nonzero loadingsthis impedes interpretability. Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) is a framework that enhances interpretability by incorporating an additional sparsity requirement in the feature weights (factor loadings) while finding a direction that explains the maximal variation in the data. However, unlike PCA, the optimization problem associated with the SPCA problem is NP-hard. While many heuristic algorithms based on variants of the power method are used to obtain good solutions, they do not provide certificates of optimality on the solution-quality via associated dual bounds. Dual bounds are available via standard semidefinite programming (SDP) based relaxations, which may not be tight and the SDPs are difficult to scale using off-The-shelf solvers. In this paper, we present a convex integer programming (IP) framework to solve the SPCA problem to near-optimality, with an emphasis on deriving associated dual bounds. We present worst-case results on the quality of the dual bound provided by the convex IP. We empirically observe that the dual bounds are significantly better than worst-case performance, and are superior to the SDP bounds on some real-life instances. Moreover, solving the convex IP model using commercial IP solvers appears to scale much better that solving the SDP-relaxation using commercial solvers. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the best dual bounds for real and artificial instances for SPCA problems involving covariance matrices of size up to 2000 × 2000.'),\n",

       "  'We consider the least squares regression problem, penalized with a combination of the `0 and `2 norms (a.k.a. `0`2 regularization). Recent work presents strong evidence that the resulting `0-based estimators can outperform popular sparse learning methods, under many important high-dimensional settings. However, exact computation of `0-based estimators remains a major challenge. Indeed, state-of-the-art mixed integer programming (MIP) methods for `0`2-regularized regression face difficulties in solving many statistically interesting instances when the number of features p ∼ 104. In this work, we present a new exact MIP framework for `0`2-regularized regression that can scale to p ∼ 107, achieving over 3600x speed-ups compared to the fastest exact methods. Unlike recent work, which relies on modern MIP solvers, we design a specialized nonlinear BnB framework, by critically exploiting the problem structure. A key distinguishing component in our algorithm lies in efficiently solving the node relaxations using specialized first-order methods, based on coordinate descent (CD). Our CD-based method effectively leverages information across the BnB nodes, through using warm starts, active sets, and gradient screening. In addition, we design a novel method for obtaining dual bounds from primal solutions, which certifiably works in high dimensions. Experiments on synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that our method is not only significantly faster than the state of the art, but can also deliver certifiably optimal solutions to statistically challenging instances that cannot be handled with existing methods. We open source the implementation through our toolkit L0BnB.'),\n",

       "  \"Component averaging (CAV) is introduced as a new iterative parallel technique suitable for large and sparse unstructured systems of linear equations. It simultaneously projects the current iterate onto all the system's hyperplanes, and is thus inherently parallel. However, instead of orthogonal projections and scalar weights (as used, for example, in Cimmino's method), it uses oblique projections and diagonal weighting matrices, with weights related to the sparsity of the system matrix. These features provide for a practical convergence rate which approaches that of algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) (Kaczmarz's row-action algorithm) - even on a single processor. Furthermore, the new algorithm also converges in the inconsistent case. A proof of convergence is provided for unit relaxation, and the fast convergence is demonstrated on image reconstruction problems of the Herman head phantom obtained within the SNARK93 image reconstruction software package. Both reconstructed images and convergence plots are presented. The practical consequences of the new technique are far reaching for real-world problems in which iterative algorithms are used for solving large, sparse, unstructured and often inconsistent systems of linear equations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.\"),\n",

       "  'Component averaging (CAV) was recently introduced by Censor, Gordon, and Gordon as a new iterative parallel technique suitable for large and sparse unstructured systems of linear equations. Based on earlier work of Byrne and Censor, it uses diagonal weighting matrices, with pixel-related weights determined by the sparsity of the system matrix. CAV is inherently parallel (similar to the very slowly converging Cimmino method) but its practical convergence on problems of image reconstruction from projections is similar to that of the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). Parallel techniques are becoming more important for practical image reconstruction since they are relevant not only for supercomputers but also for the increasingly prevalent multiprocessor workstations. This paper reports on experimental results with a block-iterative version of component averaging (BICAV). When BICAV is optimized for block size and relaxation parameters, its very first iterates are far superior to those of CAV, and more or less on a par with ART. Similar to CAV, BICAV is also inherently parallel. The fast convergence is demonstrated on problems of image reconstruction from projections, using the SNARK93 image reconstruction software package. Detailed plots of various measures of convergence, and reconstructed images are presented. © 2001 IEEE.'),\n",

       "  'Frequently, we use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (MPP) even in cases when we do not require all of its defining properties. But if the running time and the storage size are critical, we can do better. By discarding some constraints needed for the MPP, we gain freedom to optimize other aspects of the new pseudoinverse. A sparser pseudoinverse reduces the amount of computation and storage. We propose a method to compute a sparse pseudoinverse and show that it offers sizable improvements in speed and storage, with a small loss in the least-squares performance. Differently from previous approaches, we do not attempt to approximate the MPP, but rather to produce an exact but sparse pseudoinverse. In the underdetermined (compressed sensing) scenario we prove that the rescaled sparse pseudoinverse yields an unbiased estimate of the unknown vector, and we demonstrate its potential in iterative sparse recovery algorithms, pointing out directions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.'),\n",

In the MMV setting, more than one measurement vector is available and the multiple signals to be recovered share some commonalities such as a common support. Applications in which MMV is a naturally occurring phenomenon include online streaming, medical imaging, and video recovery. This work presents a stochastic iterative algorithm for the support recovery of jointly sparse corrupted MMV. We present a variant of the sparse randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for corrupted MMV and compare our proposed method with an existing Kaczmarz type algorithm for MMV problems.

       "  'Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a preclinical imaging technique capable of visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of magnetic nanoparticles. The image reconstruction of this fast and dynamic process relies on efficiently solving an ill-posed inverse problem. Current approaches to reconstruct the tracer concentration from its measurements are either adapted to image characteristics of MPI but suffer from higher computational complexity and slower convergence or are fast but lack in the image quality of the reconstructed images. In this work we propose a novel MPI reconstruction method to combine the advantages of both approaches into a single algorithm. The underlying sparsity prior is based on an undecimated wavelet transform and is integrated into a fast row-action framework to solve the corresponding MPI minimization problem. Its performance is numerically evaluated against a classical FISTA approach on simulated and real MPI data. We also compare the results to the state-of-the-art MPI reconstruction methods. In all cases, our approach shows better reconstruction results and at the same time accelerates the convergence rate of the underlying row-action algorithm.'),\n",

Such a combination of solutions, while not strictly sparse, approximates an MMSE estimator and can outperform strictly sparse solvers in terms of l-2 reconstruction error. We introduce a novel method for obtaining such an approximate MMSE estimator by replacing the deterministic thresholding operator of Iterative Hard Thresholding with a randomized version.

For computing these points, we can use different methods, and, in particular, the lower-order schemes. This opens a possibility for the latter methods to overpass traditional limits of the Complexity Theory. As an example, we obtain a new second-order method with the convergence rate O(k- 4) , where k is the iteration counter. This rate is better than the maximal possible rate of convergence for this type of methods, as applied to functions with Lipschitz continuous Hessian. We also present new methods with the exact auxiliary search procedure, which have the rate of convergence O(k-(3p+1)/2) , where p≥ 1 is the order of the proximal operator.

Efficient Microorganisms, as a microbial inoculantion, resto- re soil microbiological balance, improve its physical and chemical conditions, increase crop production and protection, preserve natural resources, and ge- nerate a more sustainable agriculture and environ- ment. They can be used in the livestock (cattle, por- ciculture and poultry) for animal husbandry and the increase of productive variables. All this maximizes the efficiency of the systems and the management of excreta and facilities.'),\n",

This technique known as \"compressed sensing\" or \"compressive sampling\" relies on properties of the sensing matrix such as the restricted isometry property. In this Note, we establish new results about the accuracy of the reconstruction from undersampled measurements which improve on earlier estimates, and have the advantage of being more elegant.
